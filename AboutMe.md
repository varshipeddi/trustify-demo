Hi, I’m **Varshith Chandra Peddi**, a Computer Science student at **The University of Texas at Dallas** passionate about building AI-driven solutions that create real-world impact.  

I enjoy combining data, machine learning, and intuitive design to solve meaningful problems. Recently, I worked on **Trustify**, an AI-powered authenticity verification tool that detects counterfeit products using deep learning.  

I’ve also explored projects involving **audio stem separation**, **data visualization**, and **app development**, and I’m currently focused on expanding my skills in **AI/ML, full-stack development, and data engineering**.
